# Authentication Overview

Welcome to the authentication section of our API documentation. This part of the documentation covers the endpoints and methods used for user authentication, ensuring secure access to our services.

## Purpose

Authentication is a crucial part of any application to safeguard user data and provide secure access to various resources. This documentation helps you understand how to implement and use our authentication mechanisms effectively.

## Available Endpoints

Below are the primary endpoints covered in this section:

- **Login**: Authenticate users and retrieve a token.
- **Register**: Create new user accounts.
- **Refresh Token**: Obtain a new token when the current one is expired or about to expire.
- **Logout**: Invalidate the current session to prevent further access.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Register**: A new user signs up with their credentials.
2. **Login**: The user provides their credentials to receive an authentication token.
3. **Use Token**: The token is used in subsequent API requests as an authorization header.
4. **Refresh Token**: If the token is close to expiring, the user can request a new one without logging in again.
5. **Logout**: The user logs out to invalidate the token and end the session.

## Security Measures

- **Token-Based Authentication**: The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Secure Password Handling**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext and are hashed before being stored.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all API interactions are over HTTPS to prevent data interception.

## How to Get Started

To get started with authentication:

1. Visit the [Register Endpoint Documentation](/register) for user sign-up details.
2. Proceed to the [Login Endpoint Documentation](/login) to understand how to authenticate and obtain tokens.
3. Learn how to [Refresh Tokens](/refresh-token) to maintain session continuity.
4. Explore the [Logout Endpoint](/logout) to securely end user sessions.
